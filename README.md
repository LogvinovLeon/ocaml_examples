# Learning ocaml

I'm currently learning ocaml, cause we will be using it during Jane Street eth1 Hackathon.
I use this repo to store some examples of my code and to ask my friends for a code-review.
It's not my first experience with functional languages (I've tried erlang & elixir), but it's the first strongly statically typed functional langguage I will be using.
